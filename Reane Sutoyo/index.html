                <p class="lead mb-5"> <strong>What makes IT interesting for you?</strong> <br> I think Information Technology subject is very broad and It allows me to take my career to next level. I think studying IT will expose me to many different career opportunities.
                    I particularly interested with UI/UX Design, Website Development and App development.
                    <p>I would love to make a website and App that works and useful for people in the future. What lead you to study in RMIT? I always wanted to expand my IT career prospect and I know I need to have to a degree in IT.</p>

                    <p>I want to go to university but because my current work obligation I could not go to normal university classes, so I am looking around and found that RMIT offer online classes and I know RMIT is one the best university to study IT degree.
                        <p>

                            <strong>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</strong>
                            <p>I have been interested in IT since I am learning to make my own website with Html5 and CSS. </p>

                            <strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong>
                            <p>I expecting to learn many different fields of Information Technology, but I particularly interested in Website and APP development. I also just started introduction to programming class.</p>
                            <p>It is challenging at first, but when I got the program to work,I feel a sense of accomplishment.</p>

                        <p>I particularly interested with Website and App development since I want to be able to create highly function website with interactive content. </p>
                        <p>I only know how to make a simple website using HTML5 and CSS at the moment. </p>
                        <p>I also familiar with ADOBE CC software including photoshop, illustrator and InDesign.</p>
                        My plan to obtain the skills is I will try to learn jQuery, JavaScript and AJAX including SVG, GIT, JIRA, API integration.</p>
                        <p>I might need to do some internship in my free time to gain some industry experienceas while studying online with RMIT University.</p>

                        <p>There are many areas that I haven’t familiar with like some of the programming language that they mentioned in the advertisement.</p>

                        <p>This position is very appealing to me because not only it looks challenging, but also design related, and I know that I must learn a lot of thing.</p>

                        <p> This infectious enthusiasm has the dual benefit of giving Campaigners a chance to make more social connections, and of giving them a new source of information and experience, as they fit their new friends’ opinions into their existing

                        <p> It’s hard for Campaigners to maintain interest as tasks drift towards routine, administrative matters, and away from broader concepts.</p>
